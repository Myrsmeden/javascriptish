The identified common misconceptions among novice programmers are:

1 Variables in different scopes
2 Usage of function parameters
3 Calling functions
4 Catching return values
5 If usage inside loops
6 Breaking out of loops

(number for identification, not priority)

1. An example of this is declaring a variable inside the body of a function, and then expect it to be available outside of the function.

2. Students have troubles with naming the parameters and providing the correct number of parameters to their declared functions

3. Students tend to forget to call their declared functions

4. If a function returns a value, the students do not always assign that value to a variable like "nonVoidFunction()" instead of "var x = nonVoidFunction()"

5,6. Students use boolean variables and if statements to handle loops and do not use break or return to terminate when the loop could be done.
